## Getting Started
### Conda (Recommended)

```bash
# Tensorflow CPU
conda env create -f conda-cpu.yml
conda activate yolov4-cpu

# Tensorflow GPU
conda env create -f conda-gpu.yml
conda activate yolov4-gpu
```

### Pip
```bash
# TensorFlow CPU
pip install -r requirements.txt

# TensorFlow GPU
pip install -r requirements-gpu.txt
```
### Nvidia Driver (For GPU, if you are not using Conda Environment and haven't set up CUDA yet)
